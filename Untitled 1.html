	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Richard Phillip Feynman was born
	on May 11, 1918 in New York City, the eldest child of father
	Melville and mother Lucille.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Lucille gave birth to another boy,
	who died at only four weeks old, and a girl named Joan.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He attended &lsquo;Far Rockaway
	High School&rsquo; from 1931-1935, and then attended the
	&lsquo;Massachusetts Institute of Technology&rsquo;.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In 1939, he was named a Putnam
	Fellow for a top five performance in the &lsquo;William Putnam
	Lowell Mathematical Competition&rsquo;, one of the most prestigious
	academic competitions in the US and Canada.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He continued his studies at
	Princeton, where he was surrounded by peers in the field such as
	Albert Einstein, Wolfgang Pauli, and John Archibald Wheeler.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He completed a thesis entitled
	&lsquo;The Principle of Least Action in Quantum Mechanics&rsquo; in
	1942, with Wheeler as his advisor.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Upon completing his thesis in
	1942, Feynman was appointed Assistant Professor of Physics at the
	&lsquo;University of Wisconsin&rsquo;, Madison.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Later that year, he was asked to
	join the &lsquo;Manhattan Project&rsquo; in Los Alamos, New Mexico
	for work on perfecting the atomic bomb before the Germans.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His responsibilities on the
	project included calculating neutron equations for nuclear reactors
	and developing safety procedures for the storage of project
	materials until its completion in 1945.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His career then became a string of
	prestigious assistantships and professorships at competing
	universities, first as Professor of Theoretical Physics at &lsquo;Cornell
	University&rsquo; from 1945-1950.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In 1948, he published his
	representations of mathematical sequences of subatomic particles,
	named the &lsquo;Feynman Diagrams&rsquo;, contributing to the
	understanding of quantum field and solid-state theories.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">For nine years after, he was
	appointed Professor of Theoretical Physics at the &lsquo;California
	Institute of Technology&rsquo;, from 1950-1959.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">The physicist dedicated research
	to breakthroughs in superfluidity of super cold liquid helium and
	&ldquo;weak decay,&rdquo; competing against his contemporaries in
	the field.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In the 1960s, he helped to revamp
	Caltech&rsquo;s physics department by delivering a series of
	lectures and introductory level explanations to freshman at the
	university. These lectures were written and published as a set of
	textbooks called &lsquo;The Feynman Lectures of Physics&rsquo;.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was awarded the 1965 Nobel
	Prize in Physics for work on quantum electrodynamics which expanded
	upon his thesis.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In 1985, he published a book of
	stories of his life and career, Surely You&rsquo;re Joking, Mr.
	Feynman, which reached the national bestseller list.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In 1986 he was invited to
	investigate the explosion of NASA space shuttle Challenger, and
	Richard ascertained that the fatal explosion was caused due to low
	launch day temperatures.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In a televised demonstration,
	Feynman showed that the rubber rings that sealed the joints of the
	spacecraft were unable to expand quickly enough in the low
	temperatures.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">His findings shed scientific and
	political light on the matter, and this was his final major
	contribution to the field of physics.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He completed his thesis &lsquo;The
	Principle of Least Action in Quantum Physics&rsquo; which laid the
	foundation for his Nobel Prize winning work on quantum
	electrodynamics. The theory consisted of two parts, while the first
	catered to path integral formulation of quantum mechanics, the other
	dealt with pictorial representation of sub-atomic particles, better
	known as the &lsquo;Feynman Diagrams&rsquo;.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&lsquo;The Feynman Lectures of
	Physics&rsquo; was published in 1964 from a series given at Caltech,
	becoming arguably the most popular physics textbooks.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Feynman was honored with several
	awards and achievements during his lifetime, for his contribution to
	scientific advancement. He received the prestigious &lsquo;Albert
	Einstein Award&rsquo; and &lsquo;E.O. Lawrence Award&rsquo;.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He was lauded with the Nobel Prize
	in Physics in 1965 for his work on quantum electrodynamics.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He won the &lsquo;Oersted Medal&rsquo;
	in 1972 for being an outstanding teacher of physics.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He won the &lsquo;National Medal
	of Science&rsquo; for contributions to physics in 1979.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">Feynman was married to his
	high-school sweetheart Arline Greenbaum until her death from
	tuberculosis in 1945. The demise of his wife caused much emotional
	turmoil in Richard&rsquo;s life and the personal guilt for having
	made a contribution towards the destructive atomic bomb threw him
	into depression for some years.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In 1950, he married again, this
	time to a woman named Mary Louise Bell; however, the relationship
	ended in divorce shortly after.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He met Gweneth Howarth at a
	European conference, whom he married in 1960 after Gweneth was
	approved for US citizenship. Together, the two had a son Carl and
	adopted a daughter Michelle.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">It was later discovered that he
	had abdominal cancer, which he battled while performing
	investigative work on the Challenger. Near the end of his life, he
	took up art and became particularly interested in drawing portraits.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">In 1987, his cancer was treated
	surgically but it led to further complications and hospitalization.</P>
	<LI><P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">He fought through tumors, ulcers,
	and kidney failure until his death on February 15, 1988, at 69</P>
